#### Tech debt
1. The natural result of writing code about something we don't have a proper understanding of.
2. Technical debt creeps in even when you work with the best intentions, and follow the very best practices.
3. If we fail to make the program aligned with what we understand to be the proper way to think about our [...] objects, then we are going to continuously stumble into disagreement, and that would slow us down like paying interest on a loan.
4. He talks of disagreement between business needs and how the software has been written.
5. most of the time it's because developers didn't fully understand what had to be done.
6. Increasing Design effort brings diminishing results after a while, so it's up to you to find the sweet spot, based on how solid is your company planning vs how much change you can expect in the future.
7. That is: even if we build the right thing, it risks becoming obsolete fast, because of the ever-changing business landscape.

So, if you are in a hurry, that's what you should remember:
1. Technical debt is caused by a lack of understanding — it stems from disagreement between business needs and how the software has been written.
2. You can limit such disagreement... — by spending more effort on the design phase, and by properly discussing requirements with stakeholders.
3. ...or you can embrace it — by explicitly planning for lean releases and following rework. This is a better choice when the future is uncertain and might bring radical changes.
