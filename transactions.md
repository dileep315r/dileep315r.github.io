Database transactions
1. Read committed 
   1. No dirty read
   2. Non repeatable read problem and write conflict problem(or skewed read/skewed write problem)
   3. Write requires exclusive lock
2. Repeatable read
   - Maintain multiple versions of the data items
   - Rollback the transaction if later transactions have committed
   - Optimistic concurrency control
   - Cleanup the unused write items in the background
   - Snapshot isolation
3. Skewed write problem
4. Phantom read
   1. Meeting room booking problem 
   2. Solutions
      1. Materialize the conflicts
      2. Explicit locking â†’ select for update
      3. Predicate locks
      4. Index locks
      5. Table level locking
      6. Index locks, predicate locking
5. Strict serializable isolation level
   - Pessimistic control locks
   - Optimistic control, MVCC
