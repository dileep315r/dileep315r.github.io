### Licenses
#### OSI Approved licenses
Open source licenses are licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition – in brief, they allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. To be approved by the Open Source Initiative (also known as the OSI) a license must go through the Open Source Initiative’s license review process.
1. permissive
2. copyleft (or restrictive) licenses.
   1. Any software created using an open-source component with a copyleft license must also be released as open source.
      1. Strong
         1. Strong copyleft licenses (such as GPL or AGPL) are designed to ensure that any software derived from the original copyleft-licensed code remains open source and freely available to the community. For example, if you use software under a GPL license in your product and want to distribute it, the whole final product must also be distributed freely under a GPL license together with the source code. Naturally, this “viral effect” has some negative implications for monetizing commercial software products.
         2. Weak copyleft licenses have similar conditions but allow for certain exceptions. For example, you can link your software to libraries licensed under the LGPL and redistribute it without the requirement to be licensed under the same terms.
      2. Weak
