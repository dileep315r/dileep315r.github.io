1. ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. It exposes a simple set of primitives that distributed applications can build upon to implement higher level services for synchronization, configuration maintenance, and groups and naming.
2. It is designed to be easy to program to, and uses a data model styled after the familiar directory tree structure of file systems.
