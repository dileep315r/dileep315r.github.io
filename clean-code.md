#### Naming
1. Prefixes before the class names, interface names, type names denoting their type are redundant and it's an old practice. You might have seen interface names like IInterface.
2. Variable names can abbreviated if it's used in a short scope. Variable names used in long scope should have long names that describe the intent of the variable.
3. Public clas names accessible in a long scope should have short names and the private class names used in a short scope should have long names describing the intent of the class. The same goes for public and private methods.
4. Using good names leads to well written pose.

#### Functions
1. Functions should only do one and only one thing.
2. Functions should be 10 lines at max. Ideally 3 or 4 lines.
3. Classes go hide in large functions that use local variables.
4. Functions should be extracted until you drop.
5. Body of if statements can also be another function.
