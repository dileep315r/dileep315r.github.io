1. Refactoring task? Scope of the refactoring clearly defined? Risk assessed and effort estimated for rolling out the change?
2. New requirement? Requirements clearly documented? Understood difficulty to implement with current system model? Is the API frozen with clients?
3. Code base/structure familiar? Codebase exploration needed? Track code exploration task separately from the main task since the task generally overshoots the estimated time.
4. Existing code refactoring needed for the current task?
5. Any upcoming holidays, unexpected meetings, trainings and on-call duties?
6. Expecting ad hoc tasks in between?
7. Change contains design alternatives? Requires design review?
8. Database migration needed?
9. Familiar with the language, framework? Consider trial and error time.
10. Metrics needs to be scheduled?
11. Team mates too much opinionated? Time for CR iterations
12. Straight forward task syndrome?
13. Time for writing wiki/design documents considered?
14. Integration tests involved? Writing them takes more time if they are not setup properly
15. Always plan or aim for reasonable sized problem in the sprint. Donâ€™t take too big problem or too small problem.
16. Force product owners/authors to write down the requirements for the task clearly. Create tickets according to the changing requirements. Use this data to convince managers and product owners.
