#### Transactions
Database transactions
1. Read committed 
   1. No dirty read
   2. Non-repeatable read problem and write conflict problem(or skewed read/skewed write problem)
   3. Write requires exclusive lock
2. Repeatable read
   - Maintain multiple versions of the data items
   - Rollback the transaction if later transactions have committed
   - Optimistic concurrency control
   - Cleanup the unused write items in the background
   - Snapshot isolation
3. Skewed write problem
4. Phantom read
   1. Meeting room booking problem 
   2. Solutions
      1. Materialize the conflicts
      2. Explicit locking â†’ select for update
      3. Predicate locks
      4. Index locks
      5. Table level locking
      6. Index locks, predicate locking
5. Strict serializable isolation level
   - Pessimistic control locks
   - Optimistic control, MVCC

#### Distributed transactions
1. 2 phase commit protocol
2. ZAB, Raft, Paxos consensus algorithms
3. SAGA pattern
   1. Eventually consistent
   2. Guarantees that all the operations are either performed or rolled back. i.e atomicity property only.
   3. Compensating transactions, coordinator saves state, commits only if all the services have committed, otherwise compensating transactions executed in reverse order. Compensating operation should be idempotent.
